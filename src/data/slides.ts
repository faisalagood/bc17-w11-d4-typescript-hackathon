      '\r\n' +
      'TypeScript is a powerful tool for adding types to your JavaScript code, allowing you to be more strict about what types are expected to be passed into functions and how they are defined. This helps catch errors early in the development process, making your code more reliable and easier to maintain.\r\n' +
      '\r\n' +
      '# How do install it?\r\n' +
      '\r\n' +

      '### Static Typing\r\n' +
      '\r\n' +
      'This allows you to annotate your variables, parameters, and the return type of a function. It also makes your code more readable, especially when creating custom objects or using types from a specific framework.\r\n' +
      '\r\n' +
      '### Interfaces\r\n' +
      '\r\n' +
      'Interfaces are a great way to define the structure of an object. They allow you to specify all the required and optional fields, as well as the type of each field, such as a string, number, float, or custom type.\r\n' +
      '\r\n' +
      '### Type Objects\r\n' +

      '\r\n' +
      '- Improved code maintainability: Static typing makes it easier to refactor and update large codebases.\r\n' +
      '- Enhanced readability: Type annotations serve as inline documentation, making code intentions clearer.\r\n' +
      '- Better error detection: Compile-time type checking catches errors early, reducing runtime bugs.\r\n' +
      '- Improved developer productivity: Advanced autocompletion and IntelliSense features speed up development.\r\n' +

    commentary: "Interfaces are a bit like objects except you can also annotate what each field's type should be at compile time when it's being used or passed around in functions. This makes it easy to make sure there are no missing fields and every field has a type you expect it to be. You can also include that it has a function as a field and describe what return type that function should return."
